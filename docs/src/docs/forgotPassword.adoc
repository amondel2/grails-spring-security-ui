[[forgotPassword]]
== Forgot Password

Like the Registration workflow, the Forgot Password workflow is expected to be user-facing. So it's not available in the admin menu like the User, Role, and other backend functionality - you'll need to expose them to your users.

One way to do this is to replace the default `login.gsp` that's provided by the Spring Security Core plugin with this plugin's version. You can do this by running `grails s2ui-override auth` - see the section on <<customization>> for more details. If you do this your users will have links to both workflows from the login screen:

=== Forgot Password

Navigate to `/register/forgotPassword`:

image::forgot_password_start.png[]

The default is to have e-mail validation for forgetting a password.  This is now configurable which will be explained below.

After entering a valid username an email will be sent and you'll see a success screen:

image::forgot_password_sent.png[]

Click on the link in the email:

image::forgot_password_email.png[]

and you'll open the reset password form:

image::forgot_password_form.png[]

After entering a valid password you'll finalize the process, which involves storing the new password hashed in the user table and pre-authenticating, then redirecting to the configured destination:

=== Configuration

The post-reset destination url is configurable in `grails-app/conf/application.groovy` using the `postResetUrl` attribute:

[source,groovy]
----
grails.plugin.springsecurity.ui.forgotPassword.postResetUrl = '/reset'
----

If you don't specify a value then the `defaultTargetUrl` value will be used, which is `'/'` by default.

You can customize if you want to have the user get e-mails for validation before they can reset their password.  To turn off
e-mail validation set the parameter `requireForgotPassEmailValidation` to false.  If not set it will default to true.  This
can be set in `grails-app/conf/application.groovy` or `grails-app/conf/application.yml` under
[source,groovy]
----
grails.plugin.springsecurity.ui.forgotPassword.requireForgotPassEmailValidation = false
----
**If e-mail validation is turned off, it is recommended to use the forgotPasswordExtraValidation below.**



An Option to add challenge questions which can be configured as a list of items.  This will work regardless if e-mail validation is turned on.
If the e-mail validation is turned on this step will occur before the e-mail is sent out.

To make this work the domain object must have a link to your User Object. This is done by setting the `validationUserLookUpProperty` which if not set defaults to 'user'.
This can be customized in either `grails-app/conf/application.groovy` or `grails-app/conf/application.yml`
[source,groovy]
----
grails.plugin.springsecurity.ui.forgotPassword.validationUserLookUpProperty = 'user'
----

Each list item in the `forgotPasswordExtraValidation` has four options, though each should only have three.  If you have both
`labelDomain` and `labelMessage` then `labelDomain` will be used as it takes precedences.

.forgotPasswordExtraValidation List items
|===
|Header 1 |Header 2

|domain
|This is Domain object that contains any reference that is needed by prop (question) and labelDomain (answer).

|labelDomain
|This is the property in the domain object that will used to ask the question

|labelMessage
|If labelDomain is not present then this can be used as a message property to ask a question (ie if your questions are static).

|prop
|This is used a the property of the domain object to determine if the answer is correct.
|===


This can be customized in either `grails-app/conf/application.groovy` or `grails-app/conf/application.yml` but the example below is
for the yml file.

[source,groovy]
----
grails:
  plugin:
    springsecurity:
     ui:
      forgotPassword:
         forgotPasswordExtraValidation:
            -
               domain: test.Profile
               labelDomain: myQuestion
               prop: myAnswer
            -
               domain: test.Profile
               labelMessage: securityvalidations.labelMessage.label1
               prop: myAnswer2
----

You can customize the subject, body, and from address of the reset email by overriding the default values in `grails-app/conf/application.groovy`, for example:

[source,groovy]
----
grails.plugin.springsecurity.ui.forgotPassword.emailBody = '...'
grails.plugin.springsecurity.ui.forgotPassword.emailFrom = '...'
grails.plugin.springsecurity.ui.forgotPassword.emailSubject = '...'
----

The `emailBody` property should be a GString and will have the User domain class instance in scope in the `user` variable, and the generated url to click to reset the password in the `url` variable.

=== Mail configuration

By default the plugin uses the http://grails.org/plugin/mail[Mail] plugin to send emails, but only if it installed. This is configurable by registering your own `MailStrategy` implementation - see [the section on configuration|guide:customization] for more information. The plugin assumes that the Mail plugin and an SMTP server are already configured.

=== Notes

Like the registration code, consider this workflow as starter code. Run `grails s2ui-override register` to copy the registration controller and GSPs into your application to be customized.

[NOTE]
====
`RegisterController` and its GSPs assume that your User domain class has an `email` field.
