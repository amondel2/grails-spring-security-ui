=== s2ui-create-challenge-questions

.Purpose

Generates controllers, services, domain object, views, i18N, and application configuration to have challenge questions

The general format is:
----
grails s2ui-create-challenge-questions <domain-class-package> <challenge-qa-class-name> <user-domain-class-name> [number-of-questions]
----

- domain-class-package is required and is the package where domainName will live
- challenge-qa-class-name  is required and is the Name of the domain class used to store this information
- user-domain-class-name is required and is the package and name of the User class.  In most circumstance I would put this in the same package but it will work if they are different.
- number-of-questions is optional but if not given will default to 2.

----
Example: s2ui-create-challenge-questions com.mycompany Profile com.mycompany.User  4
----

This script will create one Domain Class.  This will contain a link to the user and also contain one entry for each questions and answer.

This script will create one controller which contains all the logic for handling the actions needed to provide a user interface to manage different users challenge questions and answers.

This script will create two services.  The first service is to handle to be the implementation for the controller/domain object handling the data needed to set/get questions and answers.
The second service is a listener service which ensures that anytime an answer is created or updated the value is encypted before it is stores in the database.

This script will create three views.  Each of the three views (List/index, edit, and create) will support all the CRUD operations.

This script will add lines into your application.groovy file in order to ensure the questions and answers are properly configured.

This script will one line into i18n this will be the menu item in the nav bar for spring security.
